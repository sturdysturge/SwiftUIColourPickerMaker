# ColourPickerMaker

This package contains sliders and controls for colour pickers that can be added to your project in any configuration. There are also example colour pickers that use these controls, so you have the choice between using existing pickers or building your own.

# Colour palettes

Choose a vertical and horizontal parameter for your palette and how many swatches there should be in a column and in a row. For instance, choosing hue vertically with 10 swatches will give one swatch at 0.0 hue, one at 0.1 hue and so on up to 1.0 hue. If saturation was chosen horizontally, the swatches would change from 0.0 to 1.0 saturation in the horizontal direction.

Increasing the number of swatches decreases the difference between each swatch, leading to more variations being covered.
